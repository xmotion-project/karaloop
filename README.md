Can you imagine people interacting with phones, tablets, computers and other devices without hands? 

The **xMotion Project** is an initiative to advance the development of accessible wearable hands-free interfaces that will allow anyone to interact with any device, *without hands*, simply by performing movements of the face :relaxed:

The primary goal of xMotion is to enable ubiquitous human-device interaction for all - regardles of physical abilities and environmental constrains.

## Contents of this repository

<!--This repository contains just the code for the Arduino IDE itself.
Originally, it also contained the AVR and SAM Arduino core and libraries
(i.e.  the code that is compiled as part of a sketch and runs on the
actual Arduino device), but those have been moved into their own
repositories.  They are still automatically downloaded as part of the
build process and included in built releases, though.

<!--The repositories for these extra parts can be found here:
-   Non-core specific Libraries are listed under: <https://github.com/arduino-libraries/>
    (and also a few other places, see `build/build.xml`).

<!---   The AVR core can be found at: <https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr>

<!---   Other cores are not included by default but installed through the
    board manager. Their repositories can also be found under
    <https://github.com/arduino/>.

<!--## Building and testing

<!--Instructions for building the IDE and running unit tests can be found on
the wiki:
-   <https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/wiki/Building-Arduino>
