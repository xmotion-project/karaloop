Can you imagine yourself interacting with phones, tablets, computers and other devices without hands? 

The ***karaloop*** project is an initiative to advance the development of accessible and inclusive wearable hands-free interfaces, so in the future, anyone will be able to interact with any device, from anywhere, *without hands*, simply by performing movements of the face :relaxed:

The primary goal is to enable ubiquitous human-device interaction to all, regardless of physical abilities, environmental and socioeconomical constrains.     

## Contents

This repository contains a collection of wearable prototypes which measure voluntary movements of the face and translate them 
into mouse or keyboard commands sent via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to any PC, iOS or Android device.

* [***karaloop*** P1.0](https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/wiki/karaloop-P1.0)
* [***karaloop*** P2.0](https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/wiki/karaloop-P2.0)
* [***karaloop*** P3.0](https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/wiki/karaloop-P3.0)

Each prototype incorporates/explores different contact (C) and contactless (CL) sensing technology to capture facial movements: strain gauges ([***karaloop*** P1.0](https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/wiki/karaloop-P1.0), C), potentiometers and microswitches ([***karaloop*** P2.0](https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/wiki/karaloop-P2.0), C), and magnetomers and optical flow sensors ([***karaloop*** P3.0](https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/wiki/karaloop-P3.0), c and CL). 

The ***karaloop*** wearables are not finished products yet. The Technology Readiness Level ([TRL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level)) varies across prototypes. While [***karaloop*** P1.0](https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/wiki/karaloop-P1.0) and [P2.0](https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/wiki/karaloop-P2.0) are still in feasibility evaluation and development phases (TRL 3-5), [***karaloop*** P3.0](https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/wiki/karaloop-P3.0) has been preliminary evaluated in operational environments (TRL 7).       

[***karaloop*** P1.0](https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/wiki/karaloop-P1.0), [P2.0](https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/wiki/karaloop-P2.0) and [P3.0](https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/wiki/karaloop-P3.0) use the [Adafruit Feather nRF52 Bluefruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-nrf52-feather-learning-guide?view=all) microcontroller.
