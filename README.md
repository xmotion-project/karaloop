Can you imagine yourself interacting with phones, tablets, computers and other devices without hands? 

**karaloop** is an initiative to advance the development of accessible and inclusive wearable hands-free interfaces, so in the future, anyone will be able to interact with any device, from anywhere, *without hands*, simply by performing movements of the face :relaxed:

The primary goal is to enable ubiquitous human-device interaction to all, regardles of physical abilities and environmental constrains.     

## Contents of this repository

This repository contains a collection of wearable prototypes which measure voluntary movements of the face and translate them 
into mouse or keyboard commands sent via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to any PC, iOS or Android device.

* [Model P1.0](https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/wiki/Model-P1)
* [Model P2.0](https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/wiki/Model-P2)
* [Model P3.0](https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/wiki/Model-P3)
* [*Work in Progress*](https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/wiki/Work-in-Progress)

Each prototype incorporates/explores different contact (C) and contactless (CL) sensing technology to capture facial movements: strain gauges (Model P1.0, C), potentiometers and microswitches (Model P2.0, C), and magnetomers and optical flow sensors (Model P3.0, c and CL). 

The technology readiness level (TRL) varies across prototypes. While models P1.0 and P2.0 are still in concept phase (TRL 1-2), model P3.0 has been preliminary evaluated in operational environments (TRL 6-7).       

## All prototypes in this repositoy use
