## Introduction

This document, the "Policy," outlines the **karaloop** project's (the "Project") policy for the use of its trademarks. While the Project uses open source licenses, the copyright
license does not include an implied right or license to use its trademarks. 

The role of trademarks is to provide assurance about the origin of the products or services with which the trademark is associated, but because an open source license allows 
your unrestricted modification of the copyrighted material, we cannot be sure that your modifications to the Project's materials are ones that will not be misleading if 
distributed under the same name. Instead, this Policy describes the circumstances under which you may use the Project's trademarks.

In this Policy we are not trying to limit the lawful use of the Project's trademarks, but rather describe for you what we consider the parameters of lawful use to be. Trademark 
law can be ambiguous, so we hope to provide enough clarity for you to understand whether we will consider your use licensed or non-infringing.

The sections that follow describe what trademarks are covered by this Policy, as well as uses of the trademarks that are allowed without additional permission. 
If you want to use the Project's trademarks in ways that are not described in this Policy, email karaloop@protonmail.com with *Trademark Use* in the subject. We are reasonable and
work almost anything out provided we get a request in advance. Any use that does not comply with this Policy or for which we have not separately provided written permission is 
not a use that we have approved, so you must decide for yourself whether the use is nevertheless lawful.

## Our commitment to open source principles

We want to encourage and facilitate the use of our trademarks by the community, but do so in a way that still ensures that the trademarks are meaningful as a source and quality 
indicator for our materials and the associated goods and services and continue to embody the high reputation of the materials and the community associated with it. This Policy 
therefore tries to strike the proper balance between: 1) our need to ensure that the Project's trademarks remain reliable indicators of the qualities that they are meant to 
preserve and 2) our community members' desire to be full participants in the Project.

## Trademarks subject to the guidelines

### The Project's trademarks

This policy covers:

1. The Project's word trademarks and service marks (the "Word Marks"): "KARALOOP" (whether or not in capitals)
2. The logos (the "Logos"): 

<p align="center">
	<img src="https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/blob/main/marks/karaloop_logo_combined.jpg" width="50%" />	
</p>

<p align="center">
	<img src="https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/blob/main/marks/karaloop_logo.jpg" width="15%" />	
</p>

3. And the unique visual styling of our online media and packaging (the "Trade Dress").

This Policy encompasses all trademarks and service marks, whether Word Marks, Logos or Trade Dress, which are collectively referred to as the “Marks.” Some Marks may not be registered, but registration does not equal ownership of trademarks. This Policy covers our Marks whether they are registered or not.

## Universal consideration for all uses

Whenever you use one of the Marks, you must always do so in a way that does not mislead anyone, either directly or by omission, about exactly what they are getting and from whom. The law reflects this requirement in two major ways described in more detail below: it prohibits creating a "likelihood of confusion" but allows for "nominative use." For example, you cannot say you are distributing **karaloop** materials when you're distributing a modified version of them, because people would be confused when they are not getting the same features and functionality they would get if they downloaded the materials directly from us. You also cannot use our logo on your website in a way that suggests that your website is an official website or that we endorse your website. You can, though, say you like the **karaloop** project, that you participate in the **karaloop** community, that you are providing an unmodified version of any **karaloop** material, or that you wrote a book describing how to make a **karaloop** prototype.

This fundamental requirement, that it is always clear to people what they are getting and from whom, is reflected throughout this Policy. It should also serve as your guide if you are not sure about how you are using the Marks.

In addition:

You may not use the Marks in association with the use or distribution of the **karaloop** materials if you are also not in compliance with their copyright license.

You may not use or register, in whole or in part, the Marks as part of your own trademark, service mark, domain name, company name, trade name, product name or service name.

Trademark law does not allow your use of names or trademarks that are too similar to ours. You therefore may not use an obvious variation of any of our Marks or any phonetic equivalent, foreign language equivalent, takeoff, or abbreviation for a similar or compatible product or service. We would consider the following too similar to one of our Marks:

<<Example for **karaloop**: "Any mark ending with the letters KARALOOP or ARALOOP" and "Any mark beginning with the letters KARALOOP">>

You agree that you will not acquire any rights in the Marks and that any goodwill generated by your use of the Marks inures solely to our benefit.

## Use for Software and Hardware

See Universal considerations for all uses, above, which also apply.

### Accepable uses

#### Distribution of unmodified source files, unmodified executable code we have compiled, and unmodified products and the making of products
When you redistribute an unmodified copy of our software and hardware, you are not changing the quality or nature of it. Therefore, you may retain the Word Marks and the Logos we have placed on the software and hardware designs to identify your redistribution -- whether that redistribution is made by optical media, memory stick or download of unmodified source, executable code, products and the making of products. This kind of use only applied if you are redistributing an official distribution from this Project that has not been changed in any way. You can find files for the Logos and approved designs for packaging [here](https://github.com/xmotion-project/karaloop/tree/main/marks).

#### Distribution of modified source files, executable code that you have compiled, and modified products and the making of products
You may use the Word Marks, but not the Logos, to truthfully describe the origin of the software and hardware that you are providing, that is, that the materials you are distributing are a modification of ours. You may say, for example, that "this design is derived from the source files for the [karaloop P3.0](https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/wiki/karaloop-P3.0)."

Of course, you can place your own trademarks or logos on modified versions to which you have made substantive modifications, because by modifying the source files you have become the origin of that exact version. In that case, you should not use our Logos. 

#### Statements about compatibility, interoperability or derivation
You may use the Word Marks, but not the Logos, to truthfully describe the relationship between your software/hardware and ours. Our Mark should be used after a verb or preposition that describes the relationship between your software/hardware and ours. So you may say, for example, "Bob's software for the [karaloop P3.0](https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/wiki/karaloop-P3.0)" but may not say "Bob's [karaloop P3.0](https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/wiki/karaloop-P3.0) software." Some other examples that may work for you are:

* [Your hardware] works with [karaloop P3.0](https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/wiki/karaloop-P3.0) software
* [Your hardware] uses [karaloop P3.0](https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/wiki/karaloop-P3.0) software
* [Your hardware] is compatible with [karaloop P3.0](https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/wiki/karaloop-P3.0) software
* [Your software] runs on [karaloop P3.0](https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/wiki/karaloop-P3.0) hardware
* [Your software] for use with [karaloop P3.0](https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/wiki/karaloop-P3.0) hardware
* [Your software] for [karaloop P3.0](https://github.com/xmotion-project/xMotion/wiki/karaloop-P3.0) harware

#### Use of trademarks to show community affiliation
This section discusses the use of our Marks for software such an application themes, skins and personas. The use of our Marks on websites is discussed below.

You may use the Word Marks and the Logos in themes, personas, or skins for applications to show your support for the Project, provided that the use is non-commercial and the use is clearly decorative, as contrasted with a use that appears to be the branding for a website or application.

### Uses for which we are granting a license

#### Distribution of modified software
<<Example #1: You may use the Word Marks and the Logos for the distribution of code (source or executable) on the condition that any executable is built from the official Project source code and that any modifications are limited to switching on or off features already included in the software, translations into other languages, and incorporating bug-fix patches.>>

<<Example #2: You may use the Word Marks and the Logos for the distribution of executable code on the condition that it is made from official Project source code using the procedure documented for creating an executable found at <<location of build instructions.>>

#### Distribution of software preloaded on hardware
<<Example #1: You may use the Word Marks and the Logos in association with hardware devices on the condition that the executable installed on the device is the official source executable for the Project, and that you do not suggest that the Project is the source of the hardware device itself but rather than the Marks are for the software incorporated into the device.>>

<<Example #2: You may use use the Word Marks and the Logos in association with hardware devices on the condition that the software installed on the device is modified only so far as necessary to operate on the hardware platforms and the essential functions of the software are unchanged, and that you do not suggest that the Project is the source of the hardware device itself but rather than the Marks are for the software incorporated into the device.>>

### Uses we consider infringing without seeking further permission from us
We will likely consider using the Marks in a software distribution that combines our software with any other software program an infringement of our Marks. We would consider your software "combined" with ours if you create a single executable for both software programs, as well as if by installing our software it automatically installs yours. We would not consider your software "combined" with ours if it is on the same media but requires separate, independent action to install it.
