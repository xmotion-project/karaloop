## Introduction

This document, the "Policy," outlines the **karaloop** project's (the "Project") policy for the use of its trademarks. While the Project uses open source licenses, the copyright
license does not include an implied right or license to use its trademarks. 

The role of trademarks is to provide assurance about the origin of the products or services with which the trademark is associated, but because an open source license allows 
your unrestricted modification of the copyrighted material, we cannot be sure that your modifications to the Project's materials are ones that will not be misleading if 
distributed under the same name. Instead, this Policy describes the circumstances under which you may use the Project's trademarks.

In this Policy we are not trying to limit the lawful use of the Project's trademarks, but rather describe for you what we consider the parameters of lawful use to be. Trademark 
law can be ambiguous, so we hope to provide enough clarity for you to understand whether we will consider your use licensed or non-infringing.

The sections that follow describe what trademarks are covered by this Policy, as well as uses of the trademarks that are allowed without additional permission. 
If you want to use the Project's trademarks in ways that are not described in this Policy, email karaloop@protonmail.com with trademark use in the subject. We are reasonable and
work almost anything out provided we get a request in advance. Any use that does not comply with this Policy or for which we have not separately provided written permission is 
not a use that we have approved, so you must decide for yourself whether the use is nevertheless lawful.

## Our commitment to open source principles

We want to encourage and facilitate the use of our trademarks by the community, but do so in a way that still ensures that the trademarks are meaningful as a source and quality 
indicator for our materials and the associated goods and services and continue to embody the high reputation of the materials and the community associated with it. This Policy 
therefore tries to strike the proper balance between: 1) our need to ensure that the Project's trademarks remain reliable indicators of the qualities that they are meant to 
preserve and 2) our community members' desire to be full participants in the Project.
