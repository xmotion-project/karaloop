## Introduction

This document, the "Policy," outlines the ***karaloop*** project's (the "Project") policy for the use of its trademarks. While the Project uses open source licenses, the copyright license does not include an implied right or license to use its trademarks. 

The role of trademarks is to provide assurance about the origin of the products or services with which the trademark is associated, but because an open source license allows your unrestricted modification of the copyrighted materials (the "Materials", e.g. illustrations, source files, code, designs, schematics, documentation), we cannot be sure that your modifications to the Project's Materials are ones that will not be misleading if distributed under the same name. Instead, this Policy describes the circumstances under which you may use the Project's trademarks.

In this Policy we are not trying to limit the lawful use of the Project's trademarks, but rather describe for you what we consider the parameters of lawful use to be. Trademark law can be ambiguous, so we hope to provide enough clarity for you to understand whether we will consider your use licensed or non-infringing.

The sections that follow describe what trademarks are covered by this Policy, as well as uses of the trademarks that are allowed without additional permission. 
If you want to use the Project's trademarks in ways that are not described in this Policy, email karaloop@protonmail.com with *Trademark Use* in the subject. We are reasonable and work almost anything out provided we get a request in advance. Any use that does not comply with this Policy or for which we have not separately provided written permission is not a use that we have approved, so you must decide for yourself whether the use is nevertheless lawful.

## Our commitment to open source principles

We want to encourage and facilitate the use of our trademarks by the community, but do so in a way that still ensures that the trademarks are meaningful as a source and quality indicator for our Materials and the associated goods and services and continue to embody the high reputation of the Materials and the community associated with it. This Policy therefore tries to strike the proper balance between: 1) our need to ensure that the Project's trademarks remain reliable indicators of the qualities that they are meant to preserve and 2) our community members' desire to be full participants in the Project.

## Trademarks subject to the guidelines

### The Project's trademarks

This policy covers:

1. The Project's registered word trademarks and service marks (the "Word Marks"): "KARALOOP" (whether or not in capitals)
2. The registered logo (the "Logo"): 

<p align="center">

</p>

3. And the unique visual styling of our online media and packaging (the "Trade Dress").

This Policy encompasses all trademarks and service marks, whether Word Marks, Logos or Trade Dress, which are collectively referred to as the “Marks.” Some Marks may not be registered, but registration does not equal ownership of trademarks. This Policy covers our Marks whether they are registered or not.

## Universal consideration for all uses

Whenever you use one of the Marks, you must always do so in a way that does not mislead anyone, either directly or by omission, about exactly what they are getting and from whom. The law reflects this requirement in two major ways described in more detail below: it prohibits creating a "likelihood of confusion" but allows for "nominative use." For example, you cannot say you are distributing ***karaloop*** Materials when you're distributing a modified version of them, because people would be confused when they are not getting the same features and functionality they would get if they downloaded the Materials directly from us. You also cannot use our logo on your website in a way that suggests that your website is an official website or that we endorse your website. You can, though, say you like the ***karaloop*** project, that you participate in the ***karaloop*** community, that you are providing an unmodified version of ***karaloop*** Materials, or that you wrote a book describing how to make a ***karaloop*** prototype.

This fundamental requirement, that it is always clear to people what they are getting and from whom, is reflected throughout this Policy. It should also serve as your guide if you are not sure about how you are using the Marks.

In addition:

You may not use the Marks in association with the use or distribution of the ***karaloop*** Materials if you are also not in compliance with their copyright license.

You may not use or register, in whole or in part, the Marks as part of your own trademark, service mark, domain name, company name, trade name, product name or service name.

Trademark law does not allow your use of names or trademarks that are too similar to ours. You therefore may not use an obvious variation of any of our Marks or any phonetic equivalent, foreign language equivalent, takeoff, or abbreviation for a similar or compatible product or service. We would consider the following too similar to one of our Marks:

Examples for ***karaloop***: "Any mark ending with the letters KARALOOP or CARALUP" and "Any mark beginning with the letters KARALOOP or CARALUP".

You agree that you will not acquire any rights in the Marks and that any goodwill generated by your use of the Marks inures solely to our benefit.

## Use for non-Materials goods and services
See Universal considerations for all uses, above, which also apply.

### Uses we consider non-infringing
#### Websites
You may use the Word Marks and Logos, but not the Trade Dress, on your webpage to show your support for the Project as long as:

* The website has branding that is easily distinguished from the Project Trade Dress;
* Your own branding or naming is more prominent than any Project Marks;
* The Logos hyperlink to the Project website;
* The site does not mislead customers into thinking that either your website, service, or product is our website, service, or product; and
* The site clearly states that you are not affiliated with or endorsed by the Project.

#### Publications and presentations
You can use the Word Marks in book and article titles, and the Logo in illustrations within the document, as long as the use does not suggest that we have published, endorse, or agree with your work.

#### Events
You can use the Marks to promote the Project at events.

### Uses for which we are granting a license
#### User groups
You can use the Word Marks as part of your user group name provided that:

* The main focus of the group are the Materials;
* Any Material or services the group provides are without cost;
* The group does not make a profit;
* Any charge to attend meetings are to cover the cost of the venue, food and drink only.
* Note that the Universal considerations for all uses, above, still apply, specifically, that you may not use or register the Marks as part of your own trademark, service mark, domain name, company name, trade name, product name or service name.

#### Promotional goods
"Promotional goods" are non-Materials goods that use the Marks and that are intended to advertise the Project, promote the Project, or show membership in the Project community.

### Uses we consider infringing without seeking further permission from us
We will likely consider using the Marks as part of a domain name or subdomain an infringement of our Marks.

We would likely consider using the Marks on promotional goods for sale an infringement of our Marks.

## General Information
### Trademark marking and legends
The first or most prominent mention of a Mark on a webpage, document, packaging, or documentation should be accompanied by a symbol indicating whether the mark is a registered trademark ("®") or an unregistered trademark ("™"). See our Trademark List for the correct symbol to use.

### What to do when you see abuse
If you are aware of any confusing use or misuse of the Marks in any way, we would appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Please contact us as described below so that we can investigate it further.

### Where to get further information
If you have any questions about this Policy, would like to speak with us about the use of our Marks in ways not described in the Policy, or see any abuse of our Marks, please email us to karaloop@protonmail.com with *Trademark Use* in the subject.
